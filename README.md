## 🚀 Project Overview

CyberShield simulates real-time threat monitoring by generating procedural cyber attack data inspired by major threat intelligence platforms like:

- AbuseIPDB
- Feodo Tracker
- Emerging Threats
- CINS Score
- Spamhaus DROP

The dashboard refreshes automatically every 2.8 seconds to simulate continuous attack traffic.
